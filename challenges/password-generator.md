Password Generator Project
=================

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc
* If you refer to any thing online ensure it's in your readme.


Project brief:
-------
We are going to create a web based application that will generate a secure, random password for people who visit the page. The user should see a new password when they visit the page. There should be options to include numbers and symbols along with mixing upper and lowercase letters.

The minimum (default) password length should be 10 characters with an option to make the length up to 50 characters long.

The user should also be able to generate as many different passwords as they need.

We don't need to store the passwords anywhere.

A nice to have would be an easy way for a user to copy their generated password to their clipboard and ensure that passwords are not repeated.

What is a secure password:
-------
A secure password is usually from 10 - 12 characters long. Most modern sites allow for longer passwords (the longer the better). Ideally they should contain some special characters and a mix of upper and lower case letters. Finally some numbers into the mix will make the password much more secure.

User stories:
-------
Part of completing this project will be to understand the brief below and convert it to some user stories. In the real world its rare to get the perfect user stories when prototyping.

Best practice is to write out the smallest possible change as a story and then implement it.


Technical Approach:
-----
Feel free to use a language that you are comfortable using or want to learn.

Try to take a TDD approach where possible and show your test coverage using something like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)

Deployment
----------------------
As a web app include a way to show your work online to prospective employers.

Good luck :thumbsup:
